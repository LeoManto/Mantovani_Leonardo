            A company intends to build an <i>automating parking service</i> composed of a set of elements:

            <ul>
                <li>A software system, named <em>ParkManagerService</em>, that implements the required automation
                    functions.
                </li>
                <li>A <tt>DDR</tt> robot working as a <em>transport trolley</em>, that is intially situated in its
                    <em>home</em> location.
                    The <tt>transport trolley</tt> has the form of a square of side length <em>RD</em>.
                </li>
                <li>A <em>parking-area</em> is an empty room that includes;
                    <ul>
                        <li>an <em>INDOOR</em> to enter the car in the area. Facing the <tt>INDOOR</tt>, there is
                            a <em>INDOOR-area</em> equipped with a <em>weightsensor</em> that measures the
                            <em>weight</em>
                            of the car;</li>
                        <li>an <em>OUTDOOR</em> to exit from the <tt>parking-area</tt>. Just after the <tt>OUTDOOR</tt>,
                            there is
                            <em>OUTDOOR-area</em> equipped with a <em>outsonar</em>, used to detect the presence of a
                            car.
                            The <tt>OUTDOOR-area</tt>, once engaded by a car, should be freed within a prefixed interval
                            of
                            time <em>DTFREE</em>; </li>
                        <li>a number <tt>N (N=6)</tt> of <em>parking-slots</em>;</li>
                        <li>a <em>thermometer</em> that measures the temperature <em>TA</em> of the area;</li>
                        <li>a <em>fan</em> that should be activated when <k>TA > TMAX</k>, where <em>TMAX</em> is a
                            prefixed
                            value (e.g. <tt>35</tt>)</li>
                    </ul>
                    A <em>map</em> of the parking area, represented as a grid of squares of side length <em>RD</em>,
                    is available in the file <a href="parkingMap.txt" target="code">parkingMap.txt</a>:
                    <pre>

|0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, X, 
|X, X, X, X, X, X, X, X, </pre>
                    The map includes the positions of the <tt>parking-slots</tt> (marked above with the symbol <k>X</k>)
                    and of the <em>fixed obstacles</em> in the area (the walls marked with the symbol <b>X</b>).
                    <br /><br />
                    The area marked with <k>X</k> is a sort of 'equipped area' upon which the <tt>transport trolley</tt>
                    cannot walk.
                    Thus, to get the car in the <tt>parking-slot</tt>
                    <ks>(2,2)</ks>, the <tt>transport trolley</tt> must
                    go in cell <ks>(1,2)</ks>.
                    <br /><br />

                    The proper scene for the WEnv is reported in: <a href="parkingAreaConfig.js"

                    my auto in the <tt>parking-area</tt> and to receive as answer the number <em>SLOTNUM</em> of a free

                    <tt>SLOTNUM<k>==0</k></tt> means that no free slot is available.

                <li>I intend to <em>stop</em> the <tt>transport trolley</tt> when <k>TA > TMAX</k>, activate the

                    wait until <k>TA &lt; TMAX</k>. At this time, I stop the <tt>fan</tt> and resume the behavior of the
                    <tt>transport trolley</tt>.
                    Hopefully, the <b>start/stop</b>
                    <ks>of the fan</ks> could also be automated by the <tt>ParkManagerService</tt>,
                    while the <b>start/stop</b>
                    <ks>of the transport trolley</ks> is always up to me.
                </li>

                <li>I expect that the <tt>ParkManagerService</tt> sends to me an <em>alarm</em> if it detectes that the

            <h4>About the devices</h4>
            All the sensors (<tt>weightsensor</tt>, <tt>outsonar</tt>, <tt>thermometer</tt> ) and the <tt>fan</tt>
            should be
            properly simulated
            by mock-objects or mock-actors.

            <h4>When using a real robot</h4>
            No further requirement.

            <h4>When available a Raspberry and a sonar</h4>
            The <tt>outsonar</tt> could be a real device. We can simulate the presence/absence of a car.

            <h4>When using <k>only</k> the virtual robot or <k>no real sonar</k> available</h4>
            Consider the new requirement:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <ks>authorize</ks>: allow a manager to use the <tt>ParkServiceStatusGUI</tt> only if she/he owns

            <p>
                The goal of this section is to show a naive architecture of our system in order to have a better
                vision of
                the interactions between components that compose it.
                In this first schema, we still consider components of system as generic entities and we don't yet
                describe kind of their interactions.
            </p>
            <center><img src="img/macroArchitectureRaw.png" width="40%"> </center>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <k>ParkingSystem:</k> is the main component that handles functioning of the entire automated
                    parking. It triggers the sensors and receives their data, it sends to TrolleyCmd the actions that
                    need to be performed and comunicate with GUIs.
                <li>
                    <k>TrolleyCmd:</k> it's the component that directly interfaces with the real Trolley.
                <li>
                    <k>Trolley:</k> it's the physical Trolley that moves inside parking area and performs the commands
                    that it receives from TrolleyCmd.

                <li>
                    <k>WeightSensor:</k> it is the component that manages the data collected by the related sensor,
                    that detects presence of cars into the INDOOR area, and sends these data to ParkingSystem.
                    This component also has the goal to set INDOOR area state.
                <li>
                    <k>Sonar: </k> it is the component that manages the inputs received by the related sensor, that
                    detects the presence of cars in OUTDOOR area.
                    This component also has the goals to set OUTDOOR area state and to trigger its internal timer which
                    emits an alarm when a car is not withdrawn within time limit.

                <li>
                    <k>Thermometer:</k> it's the component that sends data about evironment temperature to Fan.
                <li>
                    <k>Fan:</k> it's the component that receives temperature data from Termometer and actives a cooling
                    system when temperature reaches the upper limit.
                <li>
                    <k>ClientGUI:</k> it's a graphic interface at the customer's disposal. It allows clients to submit a
                    parking or picking request to the ParkingSystem.
                <li>
                    <k>ManagerGUI:</k> it's a graphic interface at the manager's disposal. Its aim is to show the
                    internal state of parking area and it permits to stop or resume Trolley when necessary.

            </ul>

            <h3>First Macro Architecture</h3>
            <p>
                Via the following picture, we want to propose a first architecture in which we describe also the nature
                of components, reserving the chooices about the type of interactions for future phases.

            <h4>Component Analysis</h4>
            <p>
                Most of our component should be <a
                    href="https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/anatali/issLab2021/blob/main/it.unibo.qakactor/userDocs/LabQakIntro2021.html">QAktor</a>,
                in order to get fast prototyping and executable model of the system.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <ks>parkingmanagerservice:</ks> we consider this component a QAktor.
                    It must receive informations from any sensors and messages from GUIs.
                    It also must send messages to several component, for example to activate sensors or
                    reply to parking customer requests.
                <li>
                    <ks>trolleyCmd:</ks> it will be obtained starting from a QAktor provided by the customer into the
                    project
                    <a
                        href="https://github.com/anatali/issLab2021/tree/main/it.unibo.qak21.basicrobot">it.unibo.qak21.basicrobot</a>.
                    In order to exploit this component, also ours will be a QAktor.
                    <br>
                    It receives messages from <b>parkingmanagerservice</b> which concerning the action that
                    <b>Trolley</b> have to perform.
                <li>
                    <ks>Trolley: </ks>Customer has provided us some components, with related <a
                        href="https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/anatali/issLab2021/blob/main/it.unibo.qak21.basicrobot/userDocs/basicrobot2021.html#intro">documentation</a>,
                    that deal with several different type of trolley (real or virtual) we can use.
                    So we have the possibility to test our implementation on a virtual environment with a <i>virtual
                        trolley</i>, in order to obtain fastly our prototype.

                <li>
                    <ks>weightsensor: </ks>about this component, we don't have at our disposal any component to start with and so it could be
                    simulated by QAktor that sends messages to <b>parkingmanagerservice</b> about the weight of car that
                    is in <em>INDOOR area</em>.
                <li>
                    <ks>outsonar: </ks> customer provided to us a C library called <ks>SonarAlone.c</ks> and a kotlin
                    class called <ks>sonarHCSR04Support2021.kt</ks> that are necessary to using a physical
                    sonar to detect the presence of car in <em>OUTDOOR area</em>. For time reasons, this component could
                    be also simulated during first phases.
                <li>
                    <ks>fan:</ks> goal of this component is to manage a cooling system in order to lower the
                    temperature. We don't have at our disposal any component to start with,
                    so it could be a QAktor that receives information about temperature and actives a fan.
                <li>
                    <ks>thermometer:</ks> to manage thermometer informations, we don't have at our disposal any component to start with, so
                    it could be a QAktor. This Actor has to comunicate directly with <b>fan</b> about environment
                    temperature.
                <li>
                    <ks>clientGUI:</ks> it will create a graphic interface which implements a service that allows the
                    clients to start parking or picking operations, and to obtain informations about them.
                <li>
                    <ks>managerGUI:</ks> it will create a graphic interface which implements a service that has the goal
                    to show to manager all informations about the system state.
                    When needed, it has to also allow manager to stop and resume <b>Trolley</b>, through sending messages to
                    <b>parkingmanagerservice</b>.

            </ul>

                As mentioned in the <a href="#introduction">Introduction</a> we will use SCRUM methodology, so this

                <br>
                So, during this phase, we will not consider some components and functionalities, in order to obtain, as

                <p>In this version are applied the simplifications below:</p>
                <li>no <k>GUI</k> will be implemented (neither for the client nor for the parking-manager);
                    <div class="remark2" ;>GUIs will not be implemented because, during these early stages of

                    <div class="remark2">The manager performs its actions through the GUI, as it is not implemented
                        it cannot perform operations either</div>

                    <k>Thermometer</k> and <k>fan</k> are not considered;
                    <div class=remark2>These sensors are not considered because in this phase, we want to consider
                        only the component to build a first woking prototype of the parking system as soon as possible.
                        They will be considered in the next SPRINT.</div>
                <li>

                    <div class=remark2>With this assumption, the timeout alarm will never be emitted.
                        At this stage, only "standard" customer behaviour will be taken into account. </div>
                <li>It will be simulated only a client;
                    <div class=remark2>Only one client is involved, because we want to consider only one iteration of
                        parking and picking operations.
                        Related to this, when client arrives, INDOOR and OUTDOOR are always free.</div>
                <li>"no slots available" scenario is not considered;

			<div class="remark2">
                            <tt>weightsensor</tt> and <tt>outsonar</tt> must be triggered when a car is, respectively,
                            in INDOOR and OUTDOOR area.<br>
                            <k>parkingmanagerservice</k> is the only component who knows when a car is in INDOOR or
                            OUTDOOR area,
                            it can be notify it in two ways:
                            <ol>
                                <li>sending a <k>dispatch</k> to the sensor when a car is in the right area.
                                <li>emitting an <k>event</k>, since the sensor there are in the same context.
                            </ol>
                            During the analysis phase it can already be observed that the second solution is more
                            appropriate because
                            it is independent of the characteristics of the sensors and their quantity and position.

                <b>client</b> and <b>parkingmanagerservice</b> actors follow the logical functioning of the above model.
                <br>
                During the project phase it will be used <k>request/reply</k> messages for
                <tt>reqenter</tt>/<tt>slotsnum</tt> and <tt>carenter</tt>/<tt>receipt</tt>.
                Instead <tt>reqpickup</tt> message is fowarded via <k>dispatch</k> because there is no need for a reply
                from <b>parkingmanagerservice</b>.<br>
                Considering that there isn't a real or a virtual trolley, we have the necessity to simulate its moves
                and actions with some delays.

            <li>
                In <ks>carenter</ks> and <ks>picking</ks> status, <b>parkingmanagerservice</b> emits an event to notify
                the presence of a car in <em>INDOOR</em> or <em>OUTDOOR</em> area.<br>
                In <ks>carenter</ks> it's emitted <tt>carindoorarrival</tt> to notify the occupation of <em>INDOOR</em>
                area, instead in <ks>picking</ks>
                it's emitted <tt>caroutdoorarrival</tt> to report the occupation of <em>OUTDOOR</em> area.
                These events are used to trigger <b>weightsensor</b> and <b>outsonar</b> that are mock-actors into the
                same context.
                It's necessary also another event for the correct functioning of <b>outsonar</b> i.e.
                <tt>carwithdrawn</tt> that is emitted by <b>client</b> to notify that current car has been taken away
                from <em>OUTDOOR</em> area.
                Each time that this kind of events are emitted, <b>parkingmanagerservice</b> modifies the values of
                variables related to <em>INDOOR</em> and <em>OUTDOOR</em> status.<br>
            </li>
