		<h2><a name="introduction"></a>Introduction - SPRINT 3</h2>
		<div class="remark">
			<p>In this document it will be analysed the third SPRINT of the project.
				In this phase we will extend previous SPRINT's model, adding the implementation of an virtual <k>trolley</k> that performs the movements during the parking and picking phases.
			</p>
		</div>

		<h2>Requirements</h2>
		<div class="remark">

			A company intends to build an <i>automating parking service</i> composed of a set of elements:

			<ul>
				<li>A software system, named <em>ParkManagerService</em>, that implements the required automation
					functions.
				</li>
				<li>A <tt>DDR</tt> robot working as a <em>transport trolley</em>, that is intially situated in its
					<em>home</em> location.
					The <tt>transport trolley</tt> has the form of a square of side length <em>RD</em>.
				</li>
				<li>A <em>parking-area</em> is an empty room that includes;
					<ul>
						<li>an <em>INDOOR</em> to enter the car in the area. Facing the <tt>INDOOR</tt>, there is
							a <em>INDOOR-area</em> equipped with a <em>weightsensor</em> that measures the
							<em>weight</em>
							of the car;</li>
						<li>an <em>OUTDOOR</em> to exit from the <tt>parking-area</tt>. Just after the <tt>OUTDOOR</tt>,
							there is
							<em>OUTDOOR-area</em> equipped with a <em>outsonar</em>, used to detect the presence of a
							car.
							The <tt>OUTDOOR-area</tt>, once engaded by a car, should be freed within a prefixed interval
							of
							time <em>DTFREE</em>; </li>
						<li>a number <tt>N (N=6)</tt> of <em>parking-slots</em>;</li>
						<li>a <em>thermometer</em> that measures the temperature <em>TA</em> of the area;</li>
						<li>a <em>fan</em> that should be activated when <k>TA > TMAX</k>, where <em>TMAX</em> is a
							prefixed
							value (e.g. <tt>35</tt>)</li>
					</ul>
					A <em>map</em> of the parking area, represented as a grid of squares of side length <em>RD</em>,
					is available in the file <a href="parkingMap.txt" target="code">parkingMap.txt</a>:
					<pre>
|r, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, X, 
|0, 0, <bc>X, X,</bc>  0, 0, 0, X, 
|0, 0, <bc>X, X,</bc>  0, 0, 0, X, 
|0, 0, <bc>X, X,</bc>  0, 0, 0, X, 
|0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, X, 
|X, X, X, X, X, X, X, X, </pre>
					The map includes the positions of the <tt>parking-slots</tt> (marked above with the symbol <k>X</k>)
					and of the <em>fixed obstacles</em> in the area (the walls marked with the symbol <b>X</b>).
					<br /><br />
					The area marked with <k>X</k> is a sort of 'equipped area' upon which the <tt>transport trolley</tt>
					cannot walk.
					Thus, to get the car in the <tt>parking-slot</tt>
					<ks>(2,2)</ks>, the <tt>transport trolley</tt> must
					go in cell <ks>(1,2)</ks>.
					<br /><br />

					The proper scene for the WEnv is reported in: <a href="parkingAreaConfig.js"
						target="code">parkingAreaConfig.js</a>


					<center><img src="./img/parkingAreaZone.PNG" alt="parkingAreaZone.PNG" width="45%" height="32%" />
					</center>
				</li>
				<li>a <em>parking-manager</em> (an human being) which supervises the state of the <tt>parking-area</tt>
					and handles critical situations
					<!-- by using a software system named <em>ParkMonitoringService</em> -->. </li>
			</ul>

			<div class="remark">
				The job of our company is to design, build and deploy the <em>ParkManagerService</em>.
			</div>
			<!-- and the <em>ParkMonitoringService</em>.-->
			The <tt>ParkManagerService</tt> should create the <tt>ParkServiceGUI</tt> (for the client)
			and the <tt>ParkServiceStatusGUI</tt> (for the manager) and then perform the following tasks:


			<ul>

				<li>
					<hr />
					<em>acceptIN</em>: accept the request of a client to park the car if there is at least one
					<tt>parking-slot</tt> available,
					select a free slot identified with a unique <tt>SLOTNUM</tt>.<br />
					A request of this type can be elaborated only when the <k><tt>INDOOR-area</tt> is free</k>,
					and the <tt>transport trolley</tt> is at <tt>home</tt> or working (<k>not stopped</k> by the
					manager).
					If the <tt>INDOOR-area</tt> is already engaged by a car, the request is not immediately processed
					(the client could simply wait or could - optionally - receive a proper notice).
					<br />
				<li><em>informIN</em>: inform the client about the value of the <tt>SLOTNUM</tt>.</li>
				If <k>SLOTNUM>0</k>:
				<ol>
					<li><em>moveToIn</em>: move the <tt>transport trolley</tt> from its current localtion to the
						<tt>INDOOR</tt> ;</li>
					<li><em>receipt</em>: send to the client a receipt including the value of the <tt>TOKENID</tt> ;
					</li>
					<li><em>moveToSlotIn</em>: move the <tt>transport trolley</tt> from the <tt>INDOOR</tt> to the
						selected
						<tt>parking-slot</tt>;</li>
					<!-- <li>accept another request (<tt>acceptIN</tt> or <tt>acceptOUT</tt>). -->
					<li><em>backToHome</em>: if no other request is present, move the <tt>transport trolley</tt> to its
						<tt>home</tt> location,
						else <em>acceptIN</em> or <em>acceptOUT</em>.</li>
				</ol>

				If <k>SLOTNUM==0</k>:
				<ul>
					<li><em>moveToHome</em>: if not already at home, move the <tt>transport trolley</tt> to its
						<tt>home</tt> location.</li>
				</ul>

				<li>
					<hr />
					<em>acceptOUT</em>: accept the request of a client to get out the car with <tt>TOKENID</tt>.
					A request of this type can be elaborated only when the <k><tt>OUTDOOR-area</tt> is free</k>
					and the <tt>transport trolley</tt> is at <tt>home</tt> or working (<k>not stopped</k> by the
					manager).
					If the <tt>OUTDOOR-area</tt> is still engaged by a car, the request is not immediately processed
					(the client could simply wait or could - optionally - receive a proper notice).

					<ol>
						<li><em>findSlot</em>: deduce the number of the parking slot (<em>CARSLOTNUM</em>) from the
							<tt>TOKENID</tt>;</li>
						<li><em>moveToSlotOut</em>: move the <tt>transport trolley</tt> from its current localtion to
							the
							<tt>CARSLOTNUM/parking-slot</tt> ;</li>
						<li><em>moveToOut</em>: move the <tt>transport trolley</tt> to the <tt>OUTDOOR</tt> ;</li>
						<li><em>moveToHome</em>: if no other request is present move the <tt>transport trolley</tt> to
							its
							<tt>home</tt> location; <br />
							else <em>acceptIN</em> or <em>acceptOUT</em></li>

					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>
					<hr />
					<em>monitor</em>: update the <tt>ParkServiceStatusGUI</tt> with the required information about the
					state
					of the system.
				</li>

				<li>
					<hr />
					<em>manage</em>: accept the request of the manager to stop/resume the behavior of the <tt>transport
						trolley</tt>.
				</li>

			</ul>
			<h3>User stories</h3>
			As a <bc>client - parking phase</bc> :
			<ul>
				<li>I intend to use a <em>ParkServiceGUI</em> provided by the <tt>ParkManagerService</tt> to notify my
					interest in <i>entering</i>
					my auto in the <tt>parking-area</tt> and to receive as answer the number <em>SLOTNUM</em> of a free
					parking-slot (<tt>1&lt;=SLOTNUM&lt;=6</tt>).
					<tt>SLOTNUM<k>==0</k></tt> means that no free slot is available.

				</li>
				<li>If <tt>SLOTNUM <k>>0</k></tt>, I move my car in front to the <tt>INDOOR</tt>, get out of the car and
					afterwards press a <em>CarEnter</em> button on the
					<em>ParkServiceGUI</em>. Afterwards, the <tt>transport trolley</tt> takes over my car and moves it
					from
					the <tt>INDOOR</tt>
					to the selected <tt>parking-slot</tt>.
					The <tt>ParkServiceGUI</tt> will show to me a receipt that includes a (unique) <em>TOKENID</em>,
					to be used in the <i>car pick up</i> phase.</li>
			</ul>

			As a <bc>client - car pick up phase</bc> :
			<ul>
				<li>I intend to use the <tt>ParkServiceGUI</tt> to submit the request to pick up my car, by sending the
					<tt>TOKENID</tt> previously received. </li>
				<li>Afterwards, the <tt>transport trolley</tt> takes over my car and moves it from its
					<tt>parking-slot</tt>
					to the <tt>OUTDOOR-area</tt>.</li>
				<li>I move the car, so to free the <tt>OUTDOOR-area</tt>.
				</li>
			</ul>

			As a <bc>parking-manager</bc>:
			<ul>
				<li>I intend to use the <em>ParkServiceStatusGUI</em> provided by the <tt>ParkManagerService</tt>
					to observe the <em>current state</em> of the <tt>parking area</tt>, including the value <tt>TA</tt>
					of
					the temperature,
					the state of the <tt>fan</tt> and the state of the <tt>transport trolley</tt> (<k>idle, working or
						stopped</k>).</li>
				<li>I intend to <em>stop</em> the <tt>transport trolley</tt> when <k>TA > TMAX</k>, activate the
					<tt>fan</tt> and
					wait until <k>TA &lt; TMAX</k>. At this time, I stop the <tt>fan</tt> and resume the behavior of the
					<tt>transport trolley</tt>.
					Hopefully, the <b>start/stop</b>
					<ks>of the fan</ks> could also be automated by the <tt>ParkManagerService</tt>,
					while the <b>start/stop</b>
					<ks>of the transport trolley</ks> is always up to me.
				</li>

				<li>I expect that the <tt>ParkManagerService</tt> sends to me an <em>alarm</em> if it detectes that the
					<tt>OUTDOOR-area</tt>
					has not been cleaned within the <tt>DTFREE</tt> interval of time.</li>
			</ul>



			<h4>About the devices</h4>
			All the sensors (<tt>weightsensor</tt>, <tt>outsonar</tt>, <tt>thermometer</tt> ) and the <tt>fan</tt>
			should be
			properly simulated
			by mock-objects or mock-actors.

			<h4>When using a real robot</h4>
			No further requirement.

			<h4>When available a Raspberry and a sonar</h4>
			The <tt>outsonar</tt> could be a real device. We can simulate the presence/absence of a car.

			<h4>When using <k>only</k> the virtual robot or <k>no real sonar</k> available</h4>
			Consider the new requirement:
			<ul>
				<li>
					<ks>authorize</ks>: allow a manager to use the <tt>ParkServiceStatusGUI</tt> only if she/he owns
					<bc>
						proper permissions</bc>.
				</li>

			</ul>

		<h2>Requirement analysis</h2>
		<div class="remark">
			<h3>Meanings analysis</h3>
			<p>After interviewing client, meanings he associates with nouns have been clarified:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<ks>WeightSensor: </ks> is a sensor that provide weight of the car which is located in the
					INDOOR-area.
					Initially this sensor has the purpose of signaling the presence of a car in the entrance area.
				</li>
				<li>
					<ks>OutSonar: </ks>is a sensor that provide a signal if a car is located in the OUTDOOR-area.
					Initially
					this sensor has the purpose of signaling the presence of a car in the exit area.
				</li>
				<li>
					<ks>Thermometer: </ks> is a sensor that measures temperature of the environment.
				</li>
				<li>
					<ks>ParkServiceGUI: </ks>this is the GUI associated with Clients. Provides to them all informations
					concerning parking area status.
					Moreover provide buttons that permit them to make a parking request and to withdraw the car from
					this
					area.
				</li>
				<li>
					<ks>ParkServiceStatusGUI: </ks>this is the GUI associated with ParkingManager, and provides all the
					tools concerning parking area management.
				</li>
				<li>
					<ks>Transport Trolley: </ks> is a DDR robot that has the task of parking cars from INDOOR to an
					assigned park-slot and, on a withdraw request, of moving cars from park-slot to OUTDOOR.
					Trolley have three operative state: <k>idle</k>, <k>working</k>, <k>stopped</k>.
					<ul>
						<li>
							When he is in <k>idle</k> state, means that he don't has any request to serve. In this case
							he returns to his main place (<k>HOME</k>).
						</li>
						<li>
							When he is in <k>working</k> state, means that he has to serve (or is serving) a request.
						</li>
						<li>
							When he is in <k>stopped</k> state, means that there are some problems in the environment
							and the <ks>Parking Manager</ks> has manually stopped the trolley work.
							When he is in this situation, Trolley immediately stops whatever type of work it is doing
							and stays where he is.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<ks>Home: </ks>trolley's main parking area. At application start and when there are no work,
					this is tha place in where trolley wait. It is situated in the north-west corner of room,
					coordinates
					(0,0).
					<!--*REVIEW Anche quando scatta l'allarme e viene messo in attesa? Oppure resta nel punto in cui si trova in quel momento?-->
				</li>
				<li>
					<ks>TOKENID: </ks> is the <k>UNIQUE</k> an identification number of the parking operation, strictly
					associated with the
					client owner of the parked car.
					This number will be used at the end when the client decides to withdraw the car from the parking
					area.
				</li>

			</ul>

			<p>Regarding to actions (verbs):</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					When a client notify system that he wants to enter in the parking-area, receive an answer containing
					number of free slots, whether they are <k>0</k> or <k>>0</k>.
					His request will be processed when the <k>INDOOR</k> area is free.
				</li>
				<li>
					When a client make request for withdraw his car from parking-area have to enter manually his <k>
						TOKENID</k> on ParkServiceGUI.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<h3> Components Analysis </h3>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<k>trolley:</k> is a virtual robot that can move in the environment (virtual parking-area). The
					customer will provide us with this software component, called <kc>ActorBasicRobot</kc>.
				<li>
					<k>map:</k> is a representation of the parking-area map. We are already in possession of this
					software component, it was developed previously in the project <kc>it.unibo.kotlinSupports.</kc>
				<li>
					<k>parking-slot:</k> each parking slot is identified as a tuple of values (eg. <i>(3,2)</i>)
					indicating the position of the parking spaces in the map.
				<li>
					<k>weightsensor:</k> is a component that is not provided by the customer, so it will be simulated.
				<li>
					<k>outsonar: </k> is a component that may be simulated by a software or implemented by a C library
					called <ks>SonarAlone.c</ks> provided by customer and handled by a kotlin class called <ks>
						sonarHCSR04Support2021.kt</ks>
				<li>
					<k>thermometer:</k> it has not been supplied by the customer, so a sensor measuring the ambient
					temperature will be simulated by software.
				<li>
					<k>fan:</k> is a software component that will simulate the operation of a fan
			</ul>


		</div>
		<h2>Problem analysis</h2>
		<div class="remark">
			<p>As mentioned in the <a href="#introduction">Introduction</a> in this SPRINT, we will analyze a simplified
        version (with less functionality) of the final system.</p>
				<p>
					<h3>Assumptions</h3>

					In this version are applied the simplifications below:
					<br><br>
					<ul>
						<li>no <k>GUI</k> will be implemented (neither for the client nor for the parking-manager);
							<div class="remark2">GUIs will not be implemented because, during these early stages of
								project development, we will only carry out local tests.</div>

						<li>Actions of <k>Parking-Manager</k> will not be performed;
							<div class="remark2">The manager performs its actions through the GUI, as it is not
								implemented
								it cannot perform operations either</div>

						<li>
							<k>Outsonar</k> is a component simulated by a software;
							<div class=remark2>This sensor is simulated because it is not yet physically available.
								It is possible that real <b>outsonar</b> will be used in future SPRINTs.</div>

						<!--<li>
							<k>Thermometer</k> and <k>fan</k> are components simulated by a software. Reaching the
							maximum temperature does not allow the Parking Manager (which is not yet considered) to stop
							the Trolley
							<div class=remark2>Since neither <tt>Trolley</tt> and <tt>Parking Manager</tt> are not yet
								considered, when the maximum temperature si reached no action will be performed.
								Activation of <k>fan</k> will be automatized.</div>


						<li>The alarm that is emmited if <k>outsonar timer</k> expires does not causes any action;
							<div class=remark2>
								The alarm is not handled at software level, no actions will be performed.
							</div>-->

				<br>
    In this SPRINT we have added to the system a component <k>Trolley</k> with relative features. So now the movements into the enviroment are not simulated with some delays, but they are actually
    performed by a virtual robot. It's also intruduced a software component to handling and representing the virtual enviroment, in which the robot moves.
    <br>
    Subsequent to the changes made to the system, we proceed to analyze the problems encountered in this SPRINT, always considering valid the observations and analyses of the previous SPRINT about
    the already implemented components that have not been modified.
    
    <h4>Map - Configuration own map</h4>
    <p>As mentioned in requirements we need to a map that virtually represents our environment. This map it was provided by the customer
      by a software component, which documentation of its functioning is reported in 
      (<a href="https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/anatali/issLab2021/blob/main/it.unibo.planner20/userDocs/LabPlanner.html">LabPlanner.html</a>). <br>
      The client also provides us a library (<a href="https://github.com/P-damicis/Automated_Car_Parking/blob/main/unibolibs/IssActorKotlinRobotSupport-2.0.jar"><ks>IssActorKotlinRobotSupport-2.0.jar</ks></a>)
      that contains a set of tools that permits to interact and work with the system map.
      <center><img src="./img/plant.png"  width="425" height="300"></center>
    </p>
    <p>Map is necessary as a support for the planner (that is managed by some tools in the library) to calculate the fastest and safe path to a destination and to keep track of trolley moves.
      When trolley do a movement the cell of the map on which trolley is located, is updated.</p>
    <p>In our system, position of obstacles are setted a priori, because they represent boundary wall and the parking slot,
      whose position is fixed and cannot change over time. However, through one of the available tool, it is given the possibility
      to modify a specific cell of the map in case occurs.</p>
    <p>The map that is necessary to proper functioning of the system, is build througth an ad hoc handmade function that automatically creates
      the specific map file that it will be used by our system. This function can be modified in case which, in future, the parking structure change.</p>
    
    <h4>Trolley</h4>
      In this version will be added the <k>Trolley</k>. It's a software component that simulates the behavior of a real robot. This component was provided to us by the customer within the project 
      <ks><a href="https://github.com/anatali/issLab2021/tree/main/it.unibo.qak21.basicrobot">it.unibo.qak21.basicrobot</a></ks>.<br>
    How <k>trolley</k> works is specified within the specific documentation released together with the software component <a href="https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/anatali/issLab2021/blob/main/it.unibo.qak21.basicrobot/userDocs/basicrobot2021.html">basicrobot2021</a>.<br>
  To the functionalities already implemented by the Trolley it is necessary to add some others.<br>
  	<ul>
      <li><em>Trolley status</em>: it is necessary to consider the state of the Trolley. Possible states are <k>idle</k>, <k>working</k> and <k>stopped</k>. The initial Trolley state is <k>idle</k>, 				it switch to <k>working</k> while making movements and his state became <k>stopped</k> only through the direct intervention of the <b>parking-manager</b> (which is not considered in this 					   SPRINT).
      <li><em>Direction handling</em>: every time the <k>Trolley</k> completes a transport it is necessary to turn the <i>"head of the robot"</i> in the appropriate direction for loading and 					  	  unloading cars. It is possible to obtain this checking the direction in which the trolley is facing and make it turn on itself until obtaining the correct direction according to its position 				 into the map.
      <center><img src="./img/plantDir.png" width="425" height="300" ></center>
        <li id="obstacle"><em>Obstacle handling</em>: In rare and special cases there may be unexpected events that add obstacles in the environment.<br>
          In these cases, if the Trolley encounters obstacles on its path that were not already present on the map, it should stop its movement, the obstacle should be added on the map, and the 			  		  Trolley should recalculate a new path to reach its goal.
    </ul>
    
    <h4>Parking-slots traslation</h4>
    	The <k>trolley</k> can be commanded to reach a certain point on the map, indicated by a pair of coordinates.
    Relevant locations within the environment, such as <i>parking slots</i>, <i>indoor</i> and <i>outdoor</i> are identified by the system in the form of natural language words, so it's necessary to
    traslate these in the relative pair of coordinates understandable by the <b>planner</b> provided by customer, which calculates the list of movements that the <k>Trolley</k> must carry out to 
    reach the goal.
    
				<!--<h4>Handling of <k>Parking</k> and <k>Picking</k> requests (check state)</h4>
                <p>In this second SPRINT we have introduced a check, in order to verify if <tt>reqenter</tt> and
                    <tt>pickup</tt> sended by a <b>client</b> can be accepted by <b>parkingmanagerservice</b>.</p>
                <p>
                    The <tt>reqenter</tt> will be accepted if:
                    <ul>
                        <li>There is at least a free parking slot;
                    </ul>

                    By requirements, <tt>reqenter</tt> can be accepted only if there is at least one parking-slot
                    available, and can be subsequently elaborated in case of the <em>INDOOR-area</em> is free.
                    <br>If <em>INDOOR-area</em> is occupied, <b>parkingmanagerservice</b> send to <b>client</b> a
                    message <tt>waitIndoor</tt> to notify him that at this moment he can't bring his car to
                    <em>INDOOR-area</em> and that He have to wait.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The <tt>picking</tt> will be accepted if:
                    <ul>
                        <li><em>OUTDOOR-area</em> is free;</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>


				<h4>TokenID handling</h4>
				<p>In previous SPRINT, the <tt>TokenID</tt> was simply a value equals to <tt>SLOTNUM</tt> value, but now
					it's appropriate to generate a
					UNIQUE TokenID that is uniquely linked to <tt>SLOTNUM</tt>.
					So, in this version, <tt>TOKENID</tt> is a code composed by 5 digits of which the first indicates
					the <tt>SLOTNUM</tt> and the others are
					4 random digits that are added for safety reason.
				</p>
				<p>
					Furthermore all generated <tt>TOKENID</tt> are saved into a file, <ks>tokens.txt</ks>. <br>
					When a <tt>pickup(TOKENID)</tt> message arrives to <b>parkingmanagerservice</b>, it's performed a
					check that establishes
					if the inserted <tt>TOKENID</tt> is valid (if it is present in the file).<br>
					While when a car is picked by a <b>client</b> his related <tt>TOKENID</tt> is deleted from file.
				</p>

				<h4>Fan and Thermometer</h4>
				<p>
					<b>Fan</b> and <b>Thermometer</b> are two components simulated by software:
					<ul>
						<li>
							<k>Thermometer</k> simulated the measurement of parking temperatures, in particular It is considered 
							that the temperature increases progressively due to the operation of machinery within the automated car park. 
						<li>
							<k>Fan</k> continuously reads the temperature measured by the <b>thermometer</b> and checks that it
							does not exceed a certain threshold.<br>
							When the maximum temperature is reached, <b>Fan</b> actives itself, simulating the switching
							on of some fans whose task is to lower the temperature of the car park.<br>
							The <b>Fan</b> keeps in working until the temperature reaches a certain minimun threshold,
							then it deactive itself.
					</ul>
				</p>

				<h4>ParkingSlotKb</h4>
				<p>
					It's necessary to introduce a knowledge base, to permit the system to know and modify the status of
					<em>parking slots</em> and <em>INDOOR</em> and
					<em>OUTDOOR</em> areas.<br>
					As a data structure to manage the slots of parking area, it can be using a <b>boolean array</b>, while to
					represent the <em>INDOOR</em> and
					<em>OUTDOOR</em> areas status, it' possible using two <b>boolean variables</b>. <br>
					A possible way of implementing this knowledge base can be seen in the file <a
						href="..\resources\it\unibo\utils\ParkingSlotsKb.kt">ParkingSlotKb.kt</a>.
				</p>

				<h4>External tools</h4>
				<p>
					At this stage it is useful to create tools to test the functioning of the system. <br>
					Since no real GUIs are implemented yet, a python script has been created that sends
					messages to the <b>parkingmanagerservice</b> as if it were a remote client.<br>
					The file is called <a href="..\ClientGUIsimulator.ipynb">ClientGUIsimulator.ipynb</a> and it must be
					launched using <ks>jupyter notebook</ks>.

				<li>Ensure that some components work properly individually. <k><b>(unit testing)</b></k> <br>
				<br>
          </ul>
				Here it's tested the correct behaviour of <tt>trolley</tt>. During this kind of test, like in the <k>integration test</k>, the components updates some resouces whose values
				are observed and then checked.

		<div class=remark2>
			<h3>Simple moves test</h3>
      This is a preliminary test to check if the libraries used for the <k>trolley</k> movements and for the map updating, work correctly. In this way we can use the map to conduct future tests.
		</div>
		<div class=remark2>
            <h3>Path test</h3>
				The aim of this test is to verify if the <k>Trolley</k>, after having received the command to go to a certain position into the parking, 
				obtains and executes the right path to reach it. After the movements, it is checked that the calculated path is the one actually executed by the <k>Trolley</k>.
        </div>
          <div class=remark2>
          	<h3>Direction test</h3>
            This test has the goal of verifying that at the end of current travel, the <k>trolley</k> assumes the correct direction. 
            Depending on the position in which the robot is located at the end of the travel, the final direction will be different.
            For example if the destination of the travel is "indoor" that is located in the upper-right corner of the map, 
            final position of the trolley will be <tt>downDir</tt>. For park slot "p1" will be instead <tt>leftDir</tt>, so it will be for all parking slots on the left.
            For the parking slot on the right the final direction will be <tt>rightDir</tt>.
          </div>
          <div class=remark2>
            <h3>Trolley status behaviour test</h3>
            The goal of this test is to verify that in different situation the <k>trolley</k> change his status. In this version trolley status can be "IDLE" and "WORKING".
            <ul>
            <li>Trolley assumes <ks>IDLE</ks> status when it is waiting for a request of work or, after the end of a work,
              it doesn't have nothing to do and no job request is sent.
            <li>Trolley must assume <ks>WORKING</ks> state when it is actually doing a job. Returning to "home" position is not considered as a "WORKING" state.
            </ul>
          </div>
            

			</ul>

		<h2>Project</h2>

		<h2>Deployment</h2>
		The deployment of SPRINT 3 consists in a release on a <a
			href="https://github.com/P-damicis/Automated_Car_Parking/tree/main/sprint_3">Github repository</a>.

		<h2>Maintenance</h2>
		This is the third SPRINT, it is expected that the next one will be the final SPRINT, because to get the complete application is missing only the implementation of GUIs.
